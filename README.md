The FOSDEM video hardware project is about (checking the viability of) developing a 100% FOSS & open hardware video streaming platform. Some of the inspiration came from the videobrick [0][1] project.

## Hardware
### Mainboard
We're evaluating the [Olimex A20-Olinuxino-Lime2](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXino-LIME2/) as the main board.

### HDMI input
The A20 does not have HDMI input. We're looking into building a custom HDMI input board based upon the [ADV7611](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adv7611.html).
